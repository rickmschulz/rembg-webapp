**Differences from Original Code:**
1. **Behavior Fixes with File Input and Dragzone:**
    - Corrected file input behavior to prevent unwanted triggers when clicking on the input element.

2. **Page CSS Style:**
    - Updated CSS styles for improved visual appearance and alignment.

3. **Shutdown Button:**
    - Added a shutdown button for potential future use, although its current functionality is limited.
